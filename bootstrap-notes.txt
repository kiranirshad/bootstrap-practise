bootstrap notes
bootstrapn layout 
container vs container-fluid
container : it takes a fixed width 
container-fluid : it takes a full width 
 In container we have a css

margin right and left auto


Grid system
rows : in grid 1 row have 12 columns
 In rows we have a css
display flex
flex-wrap wrap
margin right and left -15px 

coumns : wevcan devide a 12 in i column 
column types
sm- small >=576
lg- large >=992
md- medium >= 768
xl- extra large >=1200
col- extra small <576

width auto
if we give 1 div to col-md-6 and we have 3 divs
 so remaing 2 div adjust ourselves according to width
 so that's width is auto width

column in orders
order-first: jis div ko order-first dowo start ma ajata h uska order zero ho jata h or baki sbka order same rhte hn
order-last: jis div ko order last ki property do wo sb se last ma chla jata h
order-1: we can an order in numbers but we should give an order to all divs
order-md-3: in this order we cahnge the orderof a div in medium size screen

column breaks 
w-010: in this class we can switch the div to next line by givving the class w-100 to before the div 

offset columns
in column we have 2 divs which have col-md-3 its total 6 columns and 6 column have not set so
 when we give the offset-md-6 wo both divs have margin and they goes to the corner in center 
we have 6 column space how much we give the offset it set to that margin
